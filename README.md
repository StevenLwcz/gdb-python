# gdb-python
Using the Python API for GDB to produce commands and TUI windows, to improve debugging ARM assembler. See the wiki for more information.

These functions were written in order to learn about and explore the GDB Python API while learning ARM 32 and 64 bit assembler.

The latest addition is vector.py to display vector registers in a much more friendly way than GDB allows.
