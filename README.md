# gdb-python
Using the Python API for gdb to produce commands, etc to help improve debugging ARM assembler. See the wiki for more information.

Current Project:
    Create a custom Tui window to display vector registers in a more filtered way. Allow to show 4 32 bit floats or 8 16 bit unsigned ints and so on.

These functions were written in order to learn about and explore the GDB Python API while learning ARM 32 and 64 bit assembler.
