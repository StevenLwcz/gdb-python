# gdb-python
Using the Python API for GDB to produce commands and TUI windows, to improve debugging ARM assembler. 

See [The Wiki](https://github.com/StevenLwcz/gdb-python/wiki) for more information.

The latest addition is vector.py to display vector registers in a much more friendly way than GDB allows and general.py an improved Tui register window. Both for AArch64 and Armv8-a.
