# gdb-python
Using the Python API for GDB to produce commands and TUI Windows to improve debugging with ARM assembler. 

See [The Wiki](https://github.com/StevenLwcz/gdb-python/wiki) for more information.

The latest additions:

1. vector.py: Display vector registers in a much more friendly way than GDB allows.
2. general.py: Improved Tui register window.
3. infogsd.py: Improved info commands for general, single, double and vector registers.

Armv8-a and AArch64 supported.
