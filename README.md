# gdb-python
Using the Python API for gdb to produce commands, etc to help improve debugging ARM assembler. See the wiki for more information.

Future plans:
    Create new tui windows to give filtered views since tui reg float and tui reg vector display more info than you are interested in.

These functions were written in order to learn about and explore the GDB Python API while learning about ARM assembler.
